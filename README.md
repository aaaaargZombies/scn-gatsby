# SCN-Gatsby

An experimental front end built with gatsby to display information about events hosted in [social centres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-managed_social_centres_in_the_United_Kingdom#UK_Social_Centre_Network) in the UK.

It consumes data from [radar](radar.squat.net) events listings via their API. It currently relies on the unpublished plugin [gatsby-source-radar](https://github.com/aaaaargZombies/gatsby-source-radar) which can be used with `yarn link` at the moment.
